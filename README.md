## Compatibility
This mod is very lightweight and changes `\legitimacy_levels\00_legitimacy_levels.txt` and overwrites the single `central_archives` technology.

## Can I modify this mod/use the code?
Not only can't really stop anyone from doing that, but I also aren't really opposed to it. However if one takes parts of this mod, give me some credit or message me.
